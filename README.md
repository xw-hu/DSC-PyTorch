# DSC-PyTorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of ["Direction-Aware Spatial Context Features for Shadow Detection, CVPR'18"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04142) and detection part of ["Direction-Aware Spatial Context Features for Shadow Detection and Removal, T-PAMI'19"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04635) based on [Xiaowei](https://xw-hu.github.io)'s [DSC (Caffe)](https://github.com/xw-hu/DSC) written by Tianyu Wang.

The Spacial IRNN is implemented by using CUDA 9.0. The backbone is ResNeXt101 pre-trained on ImageNet and the implementation of loss is from [Quanlong Zheng](https://quanlzheng.github.io).
